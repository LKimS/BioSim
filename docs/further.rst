Further Development
===================
This project allows to change parameters and add animals. The project opens for more development
where addition features can be added. Bellow are some ideas for addition features:


Use livedata from habitat
--------------------------
With being able to track a single animals you can
simulate how the rest of population will develop
and make a simulation forward in time.


Track center of population
---------------------------
Follow how the center of population moves on the island with time.


Serialisation
-----------------------------
Saving and loading the BioSim instance to/from file using pickle.
This will allow the user to save the state of the simulation and continue it later,
or share the state with other users.

Parallelization
-------------------------------------------------
Using multiprocessing/threading under the simulation to help with visualization under the simulation.
